## Important Notes

⚠️ **Before Deploying:**
- Update your Supabase credentials in index.html
- Test locally first
- Repository must be PUBLIC for free GitHub Pages

⚠️ **HTTPS Required:**
- PWAs require HTTPS
- GitHub Pages provides this automatically
- Don't worry about SSL certificates!

⚠️ **Updating Your App:**
When you make changes:
1. Update files in your repository
2. Increment version in sw.js: `const CACHE_NAME = 'radio-player-v2';`
3. Push to GitHub
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

## Need Help?

- Read **README.md** for detailed instructions
- Check **DEPLOYMENT.md** for step-by-step deployment
- Use **TESTING.md** to test your PWA thoroughly
- GitHub Pages docs: https://docs.github.com/pages

## What's Different from Your Original File?

Your original index.html has been enhanced with:

1. **PWA Manifest Link** - In the `<head>` section
2. **iOS Meta Tags** - For better iOS support
3. **Service Worker Registration** - At the end of `<body>`
4. **Install Prompt Handling** - For custom install experience
5. **Theme Color** - For system-wide app theming

Everything else works exactly the same!

## Troubleshooting

### PWA Won't Install
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify manifest.json is accessible
- Make sure you're using HTTPS (GitHub Pages does this)

### Service Worker Issues
- Increment version in sw.js
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clear cache in DevTools

### Streams Won't Play
- Check Supabase credentials
- Try CORS proxy checkbox in app
- This is not a PWA issue - it's stream-related

## Success Metrics

After deploying, you should see:

✅ Lighthouse PWA score: 90+
✅ App installs successfully on all platforms
✅ Works offline (UI loads, streams need internet)
✅ Fast loading (<3 seconds)
✅ Media controls work on lock screen
✅ No console errors

## Ready to Deploy!

You now have everything you need to deploy your Radio Player PWA to GitHub Pages. Follow the 5 quick steps above and you'll be live in minutes!
