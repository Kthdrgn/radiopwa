### What to Look For:
- âœ… Installable
- âœ… Fast and reliable on 3G
- âœ… Has a viewport meta tag
- âœ… Has a service worker
- âœ… Uses HTTPS
- âœ… Has a manifest
- âœ… Has icons

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "App won't install"
**Causes:**
- Not using HTTPS (GitHub Pages has this by default)
- Missing or invalid manifest.json
- Missing required icons
- Service worker errors

**Solutions:**
1. Check DevTools Console for errors
2. Verify manifest.json is accessible at `YOUR_URL/manifest.json`
3. Check all icon files exist in icons/ folder
4. Clear cache and try again

### "Service worker not updating"
**Solution:**
1. Increment version in sw.js: `const CACHE_NAME = 'radio-player-v2';`
2. Push changes to GitHub
3. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Or: DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Service Workers â†’ "Unregister" then reload

### "Streams won't play"
**Not a PWA issue** - this is stream-related:
- Try enabling CORS proxy checkbox
- Check if stream URL is correct
- Test stream URL directly in browser
- Some streams have regional restrictions

### "Icons don't show"
**Solution:**
1. Check icons/ folder exists and has all files
2. Verify paths in manifest.json
3. Clear browser cache
4. Uninstall and reinstall PWA

### "Works online but not offline"
**Expected behavior:**
- PWA shell (UI) should work offline
- Streaming audio requires internet connection
- This is correct for a streaming app!

## Performance Tips

### Check Page Load Speed
Use Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights:
- Aim for fast load time (<3 seconds)
- All CDN resources should load quickly
- Service worker should speed up repeat visits

### Check Bundle Size
- Main HTML file size
- Icon sizes (optimize if needed)
- CDN libraries are cached by browser

## PWA Metrics to Monitor

After deploying, you can check these metrics:

1. **Install Rate**: How many users install your PWA
2. **Retention**: Do users come back after installing?
3. **Engagement**: Time spent in app
4. **Performance**: Load time, responsiveness

Use Google Analytics or similar tools to track these.

## Security Checklist

- [x] HTTPS enabled (automatic with GitHub Pages)
- [ ] Supabase keys are anon keys (not secret keys)
- [ ] No sensitive data in client-side code
